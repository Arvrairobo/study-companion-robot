# Simple Head
## A ROS controller for the Cornell Dynamixel tablet head robot 
[Original GitHub Repo](https://github.com/guyhoffman/simple_head)

You should be able to run the nodes in this package by simply launching the [`simple_head.launch`](launch/simple_head.launch) file. Depends on [dynamixel_controller](http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_controllers)

```
roslaunch simple_head.launch
```

### Customize poses
You can add poses in the [`poses.yaml`](config/poses.yaml) config file. After you add a new pose, you should be able to send the new pose name on the `/goto_pose` topic.


### Common issues
- Make sure that you have the right USB port (usualy `/dev/ttyUSB0` but might be different on your machine).
