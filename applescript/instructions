If you saved your AppleScript as a “.scpt” file, then you can directly run it in the Terminal by typing in the following command: 

>>> osascript ScriptName.scpt


You can also run an AppleScript in the Terminal without having a script file. You’ll use the same command with -e option, and will also include the intended script in single-quotes after the command, like this: 


>>> osascript -e 'tell application "Twitter" to quit'
